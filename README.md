⚙️ System Workflow

The Storium platform follows a robust and modular workflow:

User Authentication – Secure sign-in through Google OAuth.

File Upload – Files are pinned and stored in IPFS via Pinata.

Metadata Storage – File metadata (owner, permissions, IPFS hash, size) is saved in MongoDB Atlas.

File Access & Sharing – Authorized users can access, rename, or delete files using the UI.

Subscription Management – Users can upgrade their storage plans via Paddle’s API.

Data Retrieval – Files are served via Pinata Gateway for fast and reliable access.
